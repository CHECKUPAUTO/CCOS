//! # CCOS — Causal Context Operating System
//!
//! CCOS is an experimental "kernel" that treats an LLM's working context like a
//! virtual-memory system: source code is parsed into a **causal memory graph**,
//! nodes are scored by importance / failure-relevance / recency, and a bounded
//! "context window" is paged in and out much like RAM ↔ VRAM. Every state
//! transition is recorded in an append-only **event log** so a session can be
//! replayed deterministically.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`parser`] — dependency-light line-based AST extraction (modules, `use`
//!   statements, symbols) from Rust source.
//! - [`memory`] — the causal [`memory::MemoryGraph`]: scoring, failure
//!   propagation, deterministic eviction/paging and context-window selection.
//! - [`incremental`] — `O(Δ)` graph updates: only the changed file's subgraph is
//!   re-evaluated on each edit ([`incremental::IncrementalGraphEngine`]).
//! - [`event_log`] — append-only [`event_log::EventLog`] with deterministic
//!   replay over typed [`event_log::EventPayload`] records.
//! - [`distributed_event_log`] — hash-chained, tamper-evident event log with an
//!   integrity verifier.
//! - [`llm`] — async client for an Ollama-style `/api/generate` endpoint with
//!   retries and a deterministic offline fallback.
//! - [`guard`] — validation/sanitization layer that rejects malformed model
//!   output and substitutes a safe, valid-JSON fallback.
//! - [`consensus`] — majority and confidence-weighted multi-model voting.
//! - [`adversarial`] — fault injector (JSON corruption, hallucination, prompt
//!   injection, timeouts) used to harden the guard and the graph.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! The memory graph maintains `edges ⊆ nodes × nodes` at all times (see
//! [`memory::MemoryGraph::add_edge`] and
//! [`memory::MemoryGraph::prune_dangling_edges`]), and eviction order is
//! deterministic so replays and snapshot hashes are reproducible regardless of
//! `HashMap` iteration order.
